== The Five-Section Architecture

=== Structural Overview

Impact Evaluators consist of five key sections:

**Impact**: Entities and data structures that produce and represent impact claims, translating work activities into documented impact assertions.

**Measurements**: Entities and data structures that produce independent measurements of impact, providing empirical support distinct from self-reported claims.

.MERIter measurements abstract model

**Evaluations**: Entities and data structures that synthesize measurements, claims, and other evaluations to assess impact quality, significance, and value.

**Rewards**: Entities and data structures that allocate and distribute rewards based on evaluations, completing the MERIter feedback loop.

**Governance**: Entities that govern the Impact Evaluator system. The ObjectivesDesigner steers the design of measure-evaluate-reward entities and manages the treasury funding reward distribution.

MERIters function as positive feedback loops where claims lead to rewards, and rewards incentivize further claims. This cyclical structure distinguishes Impact Evaluator systems from simple measurement or evaluation frameworks by emphasizing the dynamic relationship between assessment and incentivization.

=== Interface Design

The architecture achieves modularity through clear interfaces between sections. Each section defines inputs and outputs enabling independent development while maintaining system coherence. This allows organizations to specialize in specific sections—measurement methodologies, evaluation processes, or reward mechanisms—while contributing to the broader IE ecosystem through standardized interfaces.

== Entities Versus Data: The Essential Distinction

=== Conceptual Framework

The abstract model makes a key distinction between entities and data:

**Entities** represent active agents or processes within IE systems. These are identities within webs of trust that possess agency and responsibility. Entities perform actions, make decisions, and bear accountability for their outputs. Examples include research organizations conducting impact measurements, evaluation bodies assessing impact claims, and reward distribution mechanisms allocating benefits based on evaluations.

**Data** represent inputs and outputs within IE systems. These are attestations, ideally signed by entities, that provide formal representations of information. Data structures capture claims, measurements, evaluations, and reward allocations in formats that enable systematic processing and verification. Examples include impact claim documents, measurement datasets, evaluation reports, and reward distribution records.

This distinction enables modularity, reusability, and clear separation of concerns for effective collaboration.

=== Separation of Concerns

Separating "who does the work" (entities) from "what information is produced" (data) enables independent component development while maintaining interoperability. This addresses coordination challenges by allowing teams with different capabilities to contribute specialized components—small groups can develop measurement methodologies while larger organizations integrate multiple components into comprehensive systems.

.Technical Modularity

****
The entity-data distinction provides technical benefits that extend beyond organizational considerations. Data structures can be standardized and versioned independently of the entities that produce them, enabling backwards compatibility and gradual system evolution. Entities can be upgraded or replaced without affecting data formats, while new data requirements can be accommodated without modifying entity implementations.

=== Trust and Verification

Entities serve as identities within webs of trust, while cryptographic signatures link data to specific entities for verification and fraud detection. This enables stakeholders to assess data reliability based on trust relationships with producing entities.

== Data Structure Patterns

=== Impact Claims as Core Data

Impact claims provide self-reported documentation of impact-generating activities, exemplified by technologies like Hypercerts. Their explicit inclusion serves three critical functions:

**Separation from Third-Party Assessment**: Keeping self-reported impact claims distinct from measurements and evaluations avoids conflicts of interest.

**Composability Support**: Standardized formats enable different measurement and evaluation approaches to operate on the same impact assertions.

**Self-Sovereignty**: Producers can document work without external permission, supporting innovation and diverse approaches.

=== Measurement Integration

Measurement data provides empirical support complementing self-reported claims through standardized interfaces with three key characteristics:

- **Independence**: Measurement entities operate independently, providing objectivity
- **Methodological Diversity**: Accommodates different approaches without privileging specific methodologies
- **Temporal Flexibility**: Enables different time intervals synchronized with impact claim cycles

=== Evaluation Composability

Evaluations can be composed in arbitrarily deep hierarchies by accepting measurements, claims, and other evaluations as inputs. This enables:

**Meta-Evaluation**: Higher-level evaluations assess the quality of lower-level evaluations for quality assurance.

**Specialization**: Different entities focus on specific assessment aspects while contributing through composition.

**Stakeholder Perspectives**: Multiple perspectives compose to provide multidimensional assessments reflecting diverse priorities.

== Governance Through Meta-MERIters

=== Self-Referential Architecture

The model enables self-referential governance through "meta-MERIters"—governance activities themselves become Impact Evaluator processes. Governance activities produce impact claims that undergo measurement and evaluation, leading to rewards that incentivize effective governance participation.

=== Governance Data Structures

Meta-MERIters use specialized data structures compatible with the general IE model:

- **Governance Impact Claims**: Documentation of policy development, dispute resolution, and system maintenance
- **Governance Measurements**: Assessments of process effectiveness and stakeholder satisfaction
- **Governance Evaluations**: Synthesis determining governance quality and reward allocation
- **Governance Rewards**: Benefits allocated to effective contributors

=== Recursive Coordination

Meta-MERIters address how to coordinate coordination mechanisms themselves. By applying IE principles recursively, governance systems improve themselves through the same feedback mechanisms they provide for other activities.

The following diagram illustrates focus areas of some existing research on meta-MERIters.

== Implementation Implications

=== Standardization Requirements

Effectiveness depends on standardizing interfaces while maintaining implementation flexibility. Critical areas include:
- Data format specifications for claims, measurements, evaluations, and rewards
- Entity identification and authentication mechanisms
- Cryptographic signature requirements for data integrity
- Interface specifications for cross-section communication

=== Development Sequencing

The entity-data distinction guides implementation sequencing for early value delivery. Teams can start simple and add sophistication incrementally:

1. Basic impact claim data structures and simple impact entities
2. Measurement data structures and measurement entities for specific domains
3. Evaluation composition mechanisms and evaluation entities
4. Reward allocation data structures and distribution entities
5. Meta-MERIter governance integration

== Chapter Summary

This chapter examined the structural principles of the Impact Evaluator abstract model, emphasizing the five-section architecture and entity-data distinction. These decisions provide the modularity and separation of concerns necessary for coordination and collaboration.

The entity-data distinction enables independent component development while maintaining interoperability through standardized interfaces. The five-section architecture provides comprehensive IE system coverage while supporting diverse implementations.

Impact claims as explicit data structures address gaps in earlier models while maintaining separation between self-reported documentation and third-party assessment. Evaluation composability and recursive governance through meta-MERIters demonstrate advanced capabilities emerging from well-designed abstractions.

Chapter 3 examines impact claims in greater detail, exploring their role as core data structures and implications for self-sovereign impact documentation and verification.
