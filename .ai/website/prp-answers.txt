1a) E, but primarily A and B
1b) C
2a) C and D
2b) D but expecting A
3a) A, and C (probably focusing on individual sections such as Evaluate), but D is desirable (I'm thinking d3.js would be a great way of allowing dynamic interaction with the SVGs)
3b) A is already implemented. B is partially implemented but just opens a whole new webpage rather than animating the diagram or anything more fancy. C is partially implemented (just write different YAML files each with a different combination of annotations, and then generate separate versions of the SVG for each)
4a) B
4b) B
5a) D but mainly B
5b) A
6) D
7) D
