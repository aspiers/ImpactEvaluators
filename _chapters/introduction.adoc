= Aligning work on MERIters via semi-formal model maps

This site relates to a relatively new field of research on a common pattern of
system design which iteratively incentivizes impact projects through a
repeated loop of Monitoring, Evaluation, and Rewards of Impact ("MERI").

(Originally labelled Impact Evaluators or IEs for short, alternative names are
now being considered, such as MERIters and MER-loops.)

The applicability of this design pattern spans a huge diversity of industries,
methodologies, and theoretical frameworks.

This chapter establishes a foundational argument for why the field requires a
shared abstract model to advance both theoretical understanding and practical
implementation.

== The Challenge Landscape

=== Complexity and Scale

The MERIter field spans numerous industries, from fighting climate change to
funding Free / Open Source software. Each sector brings its own methodological
traditions, terminology, and evaluation frameworks, creating a fragmented
landscape where potentially synergistic work often proceeds in isolation.

R&D development within this field exhibits both breadth and depth
characteristics that compound coordination difficulties. Teams may pursue
broad, exploratory research across multiple domains, or focus intensively on
specific methodological innovations. This diversity, while valuable for
advancing knowledge, creates significant barriers to knowledge synthesis and
collaborative advancement.

=== Integration and Alignment Challenges

A critical challenge facing the field is the need to bridge different levels
of abstraction and implementation.  For example, theoretical simulations must
accurately approximate real-world implementations, while minimum viable
products (MVPs) need to effectively test underlying theoretical assumptions.
This alignment requirement extends beyond technical considerations to
encompass fundamental questions about how different research outputs relate to
one another and to the broader field objectives.

Any disconnect between formal research and concrete development risks limiting
the field's ability to translate theoretical advances into practical impact.
In the worst case, academic research would proceed independently of
implementation concerns, while development teams would lack access to or
awareness of relevant theoretical foundations.  Such separation can reduce the
efficiency of knowledge transfer and limit the potential for systematic
advancement.

=== Communication and Coordination Barriers

Perhaps the most fundamental challenge facing the Impact Evaluation field is
the lack of shared conceptual frameworks for communication and
coordination. Different research groups, development teams, and implementation
organizations often use inconsistent terminology to describe similar concepts,
or use identical terms to refer to different phenomena. This terminological
confusion creates barriers to collaboration and knowledge sharing that extend
far beyond simple communication difficulties.

The absence of aligned mental models compounds these communication
challenges. Without shared conceptual frameworks, teams struggle to identify
connections between their work and that of others, leading to unnecessary
duplication of effort and missed opportunities for collaboration. New
researchers and practitioners face extended onboarding periods as they must
not only learn domain-specific knowledge but also navigate the fragmented
terminological landscape.

== The Solution: A Shared Abstract Model

=== The Map Metaphor

The solution to these multifaceted challenges lies in developing what we term
a "map" of the MERIter domain. This map takes the form of a shared
abstract model that provides a common conceptual framework for understanding,
describing, and coordinating work within the field. Like geographical maps
that enable navigation and coordination across physical territories, an
abstract model of MERIters enables intellectual navigation and
coordination across the conceptual territory of the field.

The map metaphor is particularly apt because it captures several essential
characteristics of what the field requires. Maps provide standardized
representations that enable different users to locate themselves, identify
destinations, and plan routes. They abstract away unnecessary detail while
preserving essential structural relationships, and enable coordination between
different actors without requiring centralized control or homogenization of
objectives.

=== Entity Relationship Diagrams

Entity relationship diagramming (ERD) is a well-established technique for examining
the interactions between entities within a system, so we use that in this
paper as a way to map out an abstract model of MERIters.

Detailed discussion of this ERD will be presented in chapter 2; however to
give more immediately clarity on our approach to mapping, it is presented here
as a preview.

=== Facilitative Capabilities

Creating and visualizing an abstract model of MERIters facilitates
several critical capabilities that address the challenges identified above:

*Big Picture Thinking*: The abstract model provides a comprehensive overview
that enables researchers and practitioners to understand how their specific
work relates to the broader field structure. This systemic perspective
supports more informed decision-making about research directions, development
priorities, and collaboration opportunities.

*Precision of Scoping*: Clear separation of concerns within the abstract model
enables more precise scoping of projects and research initiatives. By
identifying distinct domains and their interfaces, teams can more accurately
define project boundaries and dependencies, reducing scope creep and
improving project management.

*Work Positioning*: The model provides a framework for locating specific
research outputs and development projects within the broader field
context. This positioning capability enables teams to identify their unique
contributions while recognizing areas of overlap or potential collaboration
with others.

*Connection Discovery*: By providing a common framework for describing work,
the abstract model enables identification of connections between different
research streams that might not be apparent without shared conceptual
vocabulary. This connection discovery capability supports more effective
collaboration and knowledge synthesis.

=== Structural Requirements

The development of an effective abstract model for MERIters requires
careful attention to structural characteristics that support the facilitative
capabilities described above. The model must achieve sufficient abstraction to
accommodate the diversity of approaches within the field while maintaining
enough specificity to provide meaningful guidance for coordination and
communication.

Key structural requirements include modularity, which enables different
components of the model to be developed and refined independently while
maintaining overall coherence. The model must also exhibit extensibility,
allowing new concepts and relationships to be incorporated as the field
evolves. Clarity of interfaces between different model components ensures that
teams can work effectively at component boundaries without requiring deep
knowledge of all model details.

== Implications for Field Development

=== Theoretical Advancement

The establishment of a shared abstract model creates new possibilities for
theoretical advancement within the Impact Evaluation field. By providing
common conceptual foundations, the model enables more systematic comparison of
different approaches and more rigorous testing of theoretical
propositions. Research groups can build more effectively on the work of others
when they share common frameworks for describing their contributions.

The model also supports the development of more sophisticated theoretical
frameworks by enabling researchers to identify gaps and opportunities for
theoretical development. When the field's conceptual structure is made
explicit through abstract modeling, areas requiring further theoretical
development become more apparent, leading to more strategic research
investment.

=== Practical Implementation

Beyond theoretical benefits, the abstract model provides practical advantages
for implementation teams and practitioners. Shared vocabulary and conceptual
frameworks reduce the communication overhead associated with collaboration,
enabling teams to focus more energy on substantive work rather than
terminological negotiation.

The model also supports better tool and system interoperability by providing
common conceptual foundations for technical design decisions. When development
teams share understanding of core abstractions, the systems they build are
more likely to be compatible and composable.

== Chapter Roadmap

This introduction has established the foundational argument for developing a
shared abstract model of MERIters. The subsequent chapters of this work
develop this argument in increasing detail, moving from abstract concepts to
concrete implementation considerations.

Chapter 2 examines the structure of the abstract model itself, focusing on the
critical distinction between entities and data within MERIter
systems. Chapter 3 explores impact claims as a key data structure
that enables self-reported impact documentation while maintaining separation
from third-party evaluation processes.

Chapter 4 investigates the composability and reusability properties that
emerge from properly structured abstract models, with particular attention to
how these properties enable collaboration across different projects and
organizations. Chapter 5 addresses governance considerations, including the
concept of meta-MERIters that enable governance of MERIter systems
through MERIter mechanisms themselves.

Finally, Chapter 6 presents a practical implementation roadmap that connects
the theoretical foundations developed in earlier chapters to concrete
development priorities and coordination mechanisms.
