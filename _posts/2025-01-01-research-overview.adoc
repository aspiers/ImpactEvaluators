= Research Overview: Generalized Impact Evaluators

This post provides an overview of our research into Generalized Impact Evaluator systems.

== Background

Impact Evaluators represent a novel approach to coordinating work by measuring, evaluating, and retrospectively rewarding impact achieved towards specified valuable objectives.

The concept builds on the https://research.protocol.ai/publications/generalized-impact-evaluators/[Protocol Labs research framework^], extending it into practical system architecture design.

== System Architecture

Our current research focuses on modeling the core components needed for a functional Impact Evaluator system:

=== Governance Layer

The governance layer defines:

* **Objectives**: What outcomes we want to achieve
* **Scopes**: The boundaries and contexts for evaluation
* **Measurement criteria**: How impact will be measured
* **Evaluation methods**: How measurements will be assessed

=== Impact Tracking

The impact tracking subsystem manages:

    ├── ImpactScope
        ├── ImpactClaim
        └── ImpactContributor

=== Measurement & Evaluation Pipeline

. **Measurement**: Measurers collect data on ImpactClaims
. **Evaluation**: Evaluators assess the quality and significance of Measurements
. **Reward Calculation**: RewardCalculators determine appropriate compensation
. **Allocation**: RewardAllocations distribute rewards to ImpactContributors

== Next Steps

The research will continue developing:

* Detailed component specifications
* Interface definitions between system components
* Implementation strategies for key algorithms
* Case studies of potential applications
