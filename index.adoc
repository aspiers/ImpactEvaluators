= MERIter Research

This site relates to a relatively new field of research on a common
pattern of system design which iteratively incentivizes impact
projects through a repeated loop of Monitoring, Evaluation, and
Rewards of Impact ("MERI").  It builds on the
https://research.protocol.ai/publications/generalized-impact-evaluators/[Protocol
Labs whitepaper^] on Generalized Impact Evaluators, or IEs for short.
Alternative names are currently being considered, including "MERIters"
and "MER-loops".

The applicability of this design pattern spans a huge diversity of industries,
methodologies, and theoretical frameworks.

== Overview

This research explores modularity, data and process models, and
visualizations, as approaches for coordinating work in this space.

The diagram shows the conceptual model for Impact Evaluator systems
with entities grouped into logical packages:

* Impact
* Measurement
* Evaluation
* Rewards
* Governance
