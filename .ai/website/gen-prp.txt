I want to populate the newly created Jekyll site with content covering these key themes:

- aligning on a semi-formal abstract model of IEs, and visualizing this in map form, gives us a tool with many benefits for R&D across the whole space

- R&D on impact claims, measurements, and evaluations should not be
  exclusive to the IE field, but instead should be composable for other projects such as hypercerts.org which need these same primitives. This will allow symbiotic collaboration on the intersections between the fields. This can be achieved by identifying common, unopinionated abstract base data models for impact claims, measurements, and evaluations. One easy way to achieve this is by defining EAS schemas for those abstract base models, which are designed to be extended for each use case.

The content should be a mix of text and images generated via @Makefile.  It should be largely based on @presentation.adoc, and heavily informed by:

- the PlantUML map defined in @ERD.puml, and the resulting rendering @ERD.svg

- further versions of this map which

  - contain annotations generated by the separate svg-annotator tool (which we can
    use as much as we want, and even enrich its functionality as needed), AND/OR

  - focus on subsections of the map, e.g. just the Evaluations section
    (`package` in PlantUML) - we can use PlantUML's `!define` / `!if` /
    `!include` / `!includedef` directives described in
    https://plantuml.com/preprocessing in order to dynamically render
    subsections into separate output image files, all based on @ERD.puml
    as the single source of truth for the map definition

- https://research.protocol.ai/publications/generalized-impact-evaluators/ngwhitepaper2.pdf
- https://www.hypercerts.org/docs/what-are-hypercerts and related docs

The content should probably consist of a number of different pages or chapters, but it needs to be designed in a way that it can be compiled into a single PDF.
